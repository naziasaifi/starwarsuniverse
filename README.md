# starwarsuniverse
A React-based web application to explore the Star Wars universe.

# Project Setup
Prerequisites:
Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
Installation:

1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/naziasaifi/starwarsuniverse/tree/main
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd starwarsuniverse
3. Install dependencies:
   npm install

# Running the Application
  Development:
  
  npm start
  
  This will start a development server and open your default browser to http://localhost:3000.

# Features
1. Character List(Home):View the list of Star Wars characters.
2. Search Functionality: Quickly find characters by name.
3. Character Detailed Information: View in-depth details about each character, planet, and starship.
4. Edit Character information:  Edit gender and height of a character( only UI functionality is working, Need post API to update the data)
5. Add to favourite: Add/Remove the characters from Favourite.
6. Favourite List(Favourite): View list of favourite characters.
7. Remove Favourite : Remove the characters from Favourite list.

# Technologies Used

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React Router: For handling client-side routing. 

Axios: For making HTTP requests to the Star Wars API.

Redux

Material UI

CSS Modules: For styling components.

# Improvement

1. We can store data for starship and films as well.

2. Caching: We can implement caching for imutable data.

3. Layout : Improving Application Design with a Layout Approach
   Consistency: Ensures a consistent look and feel across different pages and screens.
   Reusability: Reduces code duplication and promotes efficient development.
   Maintainability: Simplifies updates and modifications by isolating layout changes to specific components.
   Responsiveness: Enables easy adaptation to different screen sizes and devices.

4. Test cases:  we can write test cases for all component.

# Approach for much larger application

1. Modularization:

Component-Based Architecture: Break down the application into smaller, reusable components.

2. State Management:

Redux: A powerful state management library for managing complex state across multiple components.

Context API: For simple state management within a component tree.

3. Routing:

React Router: A popular routing library for managing navigation and URL changes.

Code Splitting: Use code splitting to improve initial load time and performance.

4. Styling:

CSS Modules: For scoping CSS to specific components.

5. Testing:

Unit Testing: Test individual components in isolation.
Integration Testing: Test how components interact with each other.
End-to-End Testing: Test the entire application flow.

6. Performance Optimization:

Memoization: Avoid unnecessary re-renders with useMemo and useCallback.

Lazy Loading: Load components and data only when needed.

Code Splitting: Break down the application into smaller bundles to improve load times.

7. Design System:

Consistent UI: Establish a design system with reusable components and style guidelines.

Themeing: Use a themeing solution to customize the appearance of the application.

8. Collaboration and Best Practices:

Version Control: Use Git to manage code changes and collaborate effectively.

Code Review: Conduct regular code reviews to maintain code quality.

Linting and Formatting: Enforce coding standards with tools like ESLint and Prettier.

Clean Code Practices: Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.

# Microfrontend Architecture for Large-Scale React Applications
Microfrontend architecture is a design approach that breaks down a large web application into smaller, independent frontend applications. Each microfrontend is responsible for a specific feature or business domain, and they are composed together to form a cohesive user experience.

Key Benefits of Microfrontend Architecture:

Scalability: Independent teams can work on different features simultaneously.
Flexibility: Easier to adopt new technologies and frameworks.
Resilience: Isolated failures in one microfrontend won't affect the entire application.
Testability: Easier to test individual microfrontends
